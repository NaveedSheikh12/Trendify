    name: "Retro Bollywood Glamour",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/retro_bollywood/400/400",
    prompt: "Transform the uploaded portrait into a 1990s Bollywood actress photoshoot style. Use warm golden-hour sunlight, soft lens glow, and a pastel color palette. The outfit should resemble a light saree or elegant dress with subtle jewelry. Background should include a dreamy floral or curtain backdrop with soft cinematic blur. Add gentle film grain and vintage 35mm overexposure for a nostalgic tone. The face must look luminous, eyes glossy and expressive, with a faint wind effect in the hair. Maintain photorealistic facial identity and cinematic lighting inspired by classic Indian cinema.",

    name: "3D Toy Box Character",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/toy_box/400/400",
    prompt: "Render the person as a detailed 3D collectible figure inside a transparent plastic toy box. Add glossy reflections on the plastic, a printed background card inside the box, and a small nameplate or logo near the bottom. Use realistic lighting from the top with subtle reflections on the figure’s skin and clothes. The character should look like a high-quality toy version of the real person — slightly stylized but still lifelike, with clean textures and cinematic composition. Shadows should appear naturally on the box base.",

    name: "Cyberpunk Neon Portrait",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/cyberpunk_neon/400/400",
    prompt: "Create a cinematic cyberpunk portrait with neon purple and blue lighting reflecting on the face. The subject stands under light rain, surrounded by futuristic city bokeh and glowing signs. Add wet skin shine, atmospheric fog, and a shallow depth of field for a moody, high-tech look. Lighting should feel like a movie still inspired by Blade Runner and futuristic street photography. Preserve realistic facial detail, metallic reflections, and strong color contrast between magenta and cyan tones.",

    name: "Vintage Couple Retro",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/vintage_couple/400/400",
    prompt: "Transform the photo into a cozy 1980s-style couple portrait. Place the couple on a patterned sofa with a nostalgic indoor backdrop — soft tungsten lighting, warm orange tones, and gentle vignette. Outfits should look retro — pastel saree or patterned dress for the woman, black jacket or shirt for the man. Add mild blur on the image edges for depth and vintage softness. Keep facial realism intact but slightly warm-tinted for that analog feel.",

  {
    name: "Classic B&W Studio",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/black_white/400/400",
    prompt: "Convert the image into a high-contrast monochrome studio photograph. Use single-key light from the left side, casting deep yet soft shadows on the opposite side. Capture fine skin texture, facial contours, and rich tonal depth. The mood should be serious and timeless, resembling 1950s Hollywood editorial portraits. Preserve sharp eyes, smooth transitions in light and shadow, and crisp grayscale tones with subtle film grain for authenticity.",

  {
    name: "Beach Travel Cinematic",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/beach_travel/400/400",
    prompt: "Reimagine the person as a cinematic travel influencer photo taken at golden hour on a tropical beach. Add gentle sunset light hitting the face, glowing highlights in the hair, and a soft reflection on the wet sand. Outfit should look modern and casual, with warm color grading. The background should feature blurred ocean waves, palm trees, and subtle lens flare. Lighting must feel sunlit and cinematic, with vivid tones suitable for an Instagram-style photo shoot.",
  },
  {
    name: "3D Figurine Display",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/figurine_display/400/400",
    prompt: "Create a realistic 3D figurine of the subject displayed inside a glass dome or case on a circular pedestal. Apply ray-traced lighting with glossy reflections and accurate shadows. The skin texture and clothing should look like painted resin with realistic highlights. The scene should resemble a collectible art figure under museum-style spotlights. Keep proportions slightly toy-like but preserve the face and realism.",

  {
    name: "Festive Traditional",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/festive_traditional/400/400",
    prompt: "Transform the person into a festive South Asian portrait with warm golden illumination. Add decorative fairy lights or soft glowing background bokeh. The outfit should feature traditional festive wear — richly textured fabric, jewelry highlights, and deep color tones. Maintain realistic lighting with cinematic contrast and fine detail on skin and fabric. The final image should radiate celebration, warmth, and elegance while preserving the subject’s facial features accurately.",
  },
  {
    name: "Pet Figurine Art",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/pet_figurine/400/400",
    prompt: "Render the uploaded image in the style of a realistic miniature pet figurine. The background should be a smooth velvet texture under soft spotlighting. The figure should appear small, cute, and detailed — with glossy highlights, lifelike paint texture, and a subtle shadow beneath. Capture the sense of handcrafted precision and miniature realism seen in collectible animal models. Maintain accurate proportions and realistic detailing.",

  {
    name: "Museum Oil Painting",
    previewPath: "https://picsum.photos/seed/oil_painting/400/400",
    prompt: "Convert the selfie into a 16th-century Renaissance-style oil painting. The subject should wear historical attire with detailed fabric textures and subtle golden highlights. Use warm chiaroscuro lighting — dark background, illuminated face — to create depth and realism. Simulate visible brush strokes, canvas grain, and soft tonal blending typical of classical oil paintings. Add an ornate golden frame border and soft vignette. The portrait should look like it belongs in a museum, preserving facial identity and artistic grandeur.",
